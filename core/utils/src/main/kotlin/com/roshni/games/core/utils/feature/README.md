# Feature Logic Framework

A comprehensive feature management system for the Roshni Games platform that provides centralized control over feature lifecycle, dependencies, execution, and integration with existing RuleEngine and WorkflowEngine systems.

## Overview

The Feature Logic Framework (C) provides a robust architecture for managing features in the gaming platform with the following key capabilities:

- **Feature Lifecycle Management**: Register, initialize, enable, disable, and cleanup features
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatic resolution of feature dependencies with topological sorting
- **Rule Engine Integration**: Features can be controlled by business rules and conditions
- **Workflow Integration**: Features can participate in workflow execution and state management
- **Event Handling**: Features can respond to system and user events
- **Statistics & Monitoring**: Comprehensive execution statistics and performance monitoring
- **Validation & Error Handling**: Robust validation and error handling mechanisms

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### FeatureManager
The central component that manages all features in the system:
- Feature registration and lifecycle management
- Dependency resolution and validation
- Execution coordination and statistics
- Event broadcasting and handling

#### Feature
Interface that all features must implement:
- Lifecycle methods (initialize, enable, disable, execute)
- State management and validation
- Event handling and metadata provision
- Dependency declaration and configuration

#### FeatureContext
Context object that provides execution environment:
- User and session information
- Variable storage and rule context
- Workflow context integration
- Metadata and execution tracking

## Integration Guide

### 1. Basic Setup

```kotlin
// Initialize engines
val ruleEngine = RuleEngineImpl.getInstance()
val workflowEngine = WorkflowEngineImpl.getInstance()

// Create feature manager
val featureManager = FeatureManagerImpl(ruleEngine, workflowEngine)

// Register features
featureManager.registerFeature(GameLibraryFeature())
featureManager.registerFeature(ParentalControlsFeature())
featureManager.registerFeature(AccessibilityFeature())

// Initialize
val context = FeatureManagerContext(
    userId = "current_user",
    sessionId = "current_session",
    ruleEngine = ruleEngine,
    workflowEngine = workflowEngine
)
featureManager.initialize(context)
```

### 2. Feature Execution

```kotlin
// Enable a feature
val context = FeatureContext(
    featureId = "game_library",
    executionId = "exec_001",
    userId = "current_user"
)

val enabled = featureManager.enableFeature("game_library", context)

// Execute a feature
val result = featureManager.executeFeature("game_library", context.copy(
    variables = mutableMapOf("action" to "list_games")
))

if (result.success) {
    val games = result.data["games"] as List<Game>
    // Process games
}
```

### 3. Dependency Management

```kotlin
// Check if feature can be enabled
val canEnable = featureManager.canEnableFeature("parental_controls", context)

// Resolve and enable multiple features
val resolvedFeatures = featureManager.resolveAndEnableFeatures(
    listOf("accessibility", "game_library", "parental_controls"),
    context
)

// Get dependent features
val dependents = featureManager.getDependentFeatures("security")
```

### 4. Event Handling

```kotlin
// Send event to specific feature
val event = FeatureEvent.UserAction("toggle_high_contrast")
val handled = featureManager.sendEventToFeature("accessibility", event, context)

// Broadcast event to all features
val systemEvent = FeatureEvent.SystemEvent("app_background")
val results = featureManager.broadcastEvent(systemEvent, context)
```

### 5. Rule Engine Integration

```kotlin
// Features can be controlled by rules
val ruleContext = RuleContext()
val featureContext = FeatureContext(
    featureId = "game_library",
    executionId = "exec_001",
    userId = "current_user",
    ruleContext = ruleContext
)

// Rule engine can block feature execution
val canExecute = featureManager.canEnableFeature("game_library", featureContext)
```

### 6. Workflow Integration

```kotlin
// Features can participate in workflows
val workflowContext = WorkflowContext(
    workflowId = "game_session",
    executionId = "workflow_001",
    userId = "current_user"
)

val featureContext = FeatureContext(
    featureId = "game_library",
    executionId = "exec_001",
    userId = "current_user",
    workflowContext = workflowContext
)
```

## Configuration

### Feature Configuration

Each feature can be configured with:

```kotlin
val config = FeatureConfig(
    properties = mapOf(
        "cacheEnabled" to true,
        "maxCacheSize" to 100,
        "searchDebounceMs" to 300
    ),
    timeoutMs = 10000,
    retryCount = 3,
    enabledByDefault = true,
    requiresUserConsent = false,
    permissions = listOf("READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE")
)
```

### Dependency Declaration

Features declare dependencies:

```kotlin
val dependencies = listOf(
    FeatureDependency(
        featureId = "network",
        minVersion = 1,
        requiredState = FeatureState.ENABLED,
        optional = false
    )
)
```

## Monitoring and Statistics

### Feature Statistics

```kotlin
// Get overall statistics
val stats = featureManager.getFeatureStatistics()
println("Total executions: ${stats.totalExecutions}")
println("Average time: ${stats.averageExecutionTimeMs}ms")

// Get feature-specific statistics
val gameLibraryStats = featureManager.getFeatureStatistics("game_library")
```

### Validation

```kotlin
// Validate all features
val validation = featureManager.validateAllFeatures()
if (!validation.isValid) {
    validation.errors.forEach { error ->
        println("Validation error: $error")
    }
}
```

### Status Monitoring

```kotlin
// Monitor feature manager status
val status = featureManager.status.value
println("Initialized: ${status.isInitialized}")
println("Registered features: ${status.registeredFeatureCount}")
println("Enabled features: ${status.enabledFeatureCount}")
```

## Error Handling

The framework provides comprehensive error handling:

```kotlin
val result = featureManager.executeFeature("game_library", context)
if (!result.success) {
    result.errors.forEach { error ->
        println("Execution error: $error")
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Feature Design
- Keep features focused and single-responsibility
- Declare dependencies explicitly and accurately
- Provide meaningful validation and error messages
- Implement proper cleanup in case of failures

### 2. Dependency Management
- Use optional dependencies when possible
- Provide fallback behavior for missing dependencies
- Test dependency resolution thoroughly

### 3. Performance
- Implement proper caching for expensive operations
- Use timeouts for long-running operations
- Monitor execution statistics regularly

### 4. Security
- Validate all inputs in feature execution
- Implement proper authentication for sensitive features
- Log security-relevant events

### 5. Testing
- Test feature lifecycle (init, enable, disable, cleanup)
- Test dependency resolution scenarios
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Test integration with RuleEngine and WorkflowEngine

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Features

Create custom features by extending `BaseFeature`:

```kotlin
class CustomFeature : BaseFeature() {
    override val id = "custom_feature"
    override val name = "Custom Feature"
    override val category = FeatureCategory.SYSTEM

    override suspend fun performInitialization(context: FeatureContext): Boolean {
        // Custom initialization logic
        return true
    }

    override suspend fun performEnable(context: FeatureContext): Boolean {
        // Custom enable logic
        return true
    }

    override suspend fun performExecute(context: FeatureContext): FeatureResult {
        // Custom execution logic
        return FeatureResult(success = true)
    }

    // Implement other required methods...
}
```

### Feature Composition

Features can be composed for complex scenarios:

```kotlin
// Execute multiple related features
val results = featureManager.executeFeatures(
    listOf("game_library", "parental_controls", "accessibility"),
    context
)

// Process combined results
results.forEach { result ->
    if (result.success) {
        // Handle successful execution
    } else {
        // Handle failed execution
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Feature not found**: Ensure feature is registered before use
2. **Dependency resolution failures**: Check dependency declarations and versions
3. **Execution timeouts**: Review feature timeout configurations
4. **Validation errors**: Check feature configuration and dependencies

### Debugging

Enable detailed logging:

```kotlin
// Features use Timber for logging
Timber.plant(Timber.DebugTree())

// Monitor feature state changes
featureManager.observeFeatureState("feature_id").collect { stateChange ->
    println("Feature ${stateChange.featureId} state changed: ${stateChange.oldState} -> ${stateChange.newState}")
}
```

## Migration Guide

### From Existing Systems

If migrating from existing feature management:

1. **Identify Features**: Map existing functionality to feature boundaries
2. **Declare Dependencies**: Identify and declare feature dependencies
3. **Configure Settings**: Move configuration to FeatureConfig objects
4. **Update Integration**: Update existing code to use FeatureManager API
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Test all scenarios including error cases
